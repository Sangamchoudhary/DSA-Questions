Searching and sorting tips to remember while solving questions

-> use hashing
-> sorting 
-> find sum of all elements or sum of (square of all elements) and then think about solution
-> Linear search , Binary search , Ternary search (rare cases)
-> use maths we learnt in our school time
-> Swap sort (when ques asks solve this with min. no of comparisons)
-> prefix sum with hashmap
-> prefix calculation of ( product , remainder , sum , etc. ) with hashmap
-> sometimes BIT Manipulation
